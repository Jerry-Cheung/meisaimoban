## Installation

Generally, it takes 4 steps to manually install `mcmthesis` on most of the platforms:  
1. copy `mcmthesis.cls` to `TEXMF/tex/latex/mcmthesis/`;  
2. copy `mcmthesis.dtx` and `mcmthesis.ins` to `TEXMF/source/latex/mcmthesis/`;  
3. copy other files to `TEXMF/doc/latex/mcmthesis/`; and  
4. run `texhash`.

Alternatively, you can use a package mananger to install `mcmthesis`: 

For example: If you are using `Mac OS X`, you can install [`MacTeX`](http://www.tug.org/mactex/), and add the `mcmthesis` package using `TeX Live Utility`.
